Description,11/1/2000 Opened by Jill the Very, Very Good Tester
* Start Bee Flogger
* Create an unnamed document simply containing the letter “a”
* Click on the FTP button on the toolbar
* Try to ftp to your server

BUG: Observe; the ftp server is no longer responding. Indeed ps -augx shows that it is not even running and there is a core dump in /.

EXPECTED: No crash

11/2/2000 (Yesterday) RESOLVED – WON’T FIX by Willie the Lead Developer

Not our code, Jill, that’s just proftpd which comes with Linux.

That doesn’t sound right. I’ve never been able to crash proftpd when I connect with a normal ftp client. Our code crashes it every single time. Ftp servers don’t just “crash”.

Mikey, can you look at this? Maybe your client code is doing something wrong.

I think I was passing the user name instead of the password or something…

Still happens in Build 2021.

11/3/2000 (Today) Edited by Mikey the Programmer

Whoa. That’s strange. Lemme debug this.

11/3/2000 (Today) Edited by Mikey the Programmer

I’m thinking it might be MikeyStrCpy()…

11/3/2000 (Today) RESOLVED – FIXED by Mikey the Programmer

Ahhh!
FIXED!

11/3/2000 (Today) Closed by Jill the Very, Very Good Tester

Appears fixed in build 2022, so I’ll go ahead and close this.
